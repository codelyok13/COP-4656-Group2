This is an online source code repository for Group 2 of Mobile Device Applications (COP 4656). 

# IMPORTANT: DO NOT COMMIT CHANGES TO MASTER WITHOUT CONSENT FROM THE ENTIRE GROUP.

If you want to add a new feature or bug fix, create a new branch first, then allow the group to look over it before merging it to master.
